<h1>HistoricalYearWebScrapper</h1>
This is my first foray into webscrapping, and its a project with fairly limited complexity. Its a console based program that prompts the user for a year between 1 and the present, and then gives the user an random event that happened in that year (pulled from wikipedia).
